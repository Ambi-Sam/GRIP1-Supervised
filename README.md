Prediction using Supervised ML.
Supervised learning is a machine learning technique in which an algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or decisions.
In supervised learning, we have a set of input data, also known as features, and corresponding output data, also known as labels or targets.
The objective of supervised learning is to learn a mapping function that can predict the output for new, unseen inputs. 
To do this, the algorithm is trained on a set of labeled examples, where the correct output is known.
The algorithm uses these examples to learn the relationship between the inputs and the outputs, and then uses this knowledge to make predictions on new, unseen data.
Here we use simple Linear Regressionto test the Actual versus Predicted on the given dataset.
